draw a circle if there's only one loc
draw a cross with arrow for direction if there's two locs and you're within the map boundaries
draw a circle with arrow for direction if there's two locs and you're beyond the map boundaries

if you're beyond the edge of the map, draw the marker at the edge of the map
for drawing marker on edge of map, point will be 0, so scale the vector by subtracting the other point from the point (x from y, etc.)

when you zone, all location data is invalid, so set any persistent locs (current loc) to None
