PyDWMG Window behaviour on windows and opensuse linux, both must act in the same way

Main Controller Window + Map Window + Tray Icon + Task Bar Item and Alt/Tab

Main Controller window exists to allow registration in window manager for taskbar and alt/tab item
    while allowing frameless map window to be unregistered (bypass X11) and draggable off screen in linux
Main Controller window will be always on bottom or somehow hidden as it will have no actual function

Close main window from its self or taskbar = close/minimise main window and map to tray
Close map window from its self or taskbar = close/minimise main window and map to tray
Close tray icon = exit completely

Alt/Tabbing restores windows
Clicking taskbar item restores windows
Clicking tray icon restores windows
(may need to save window geometry on minimise/close for these)

Minimise map window = minimise map and main window to tray
Minimise main window = minimise map and main window to tray

Map window must be resizable and draggable with no frame.  Transparent black and always on top must be adjustable settings
